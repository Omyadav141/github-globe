## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [Github's homepage](https://github.com/home), where they display real-time Github activity on a globe map.

## Implementation



## [Live demo](https://omyadav141.github.io/github-globe/)

All attended/cancelled flights (2019-2020) are displayed on the globe. If you try to follow one arc, that would be the sequence of travel destinations. Red arcs are cancelled flights.
